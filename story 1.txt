People aged 56 to 59 in England are being invited to book their coronavirus vaccine from this week.

Letters for people in the age group, offering them the vaccine, started being delivered to homes on Saturday.

It comes after eight in 10 people aged 65 to 69 have taken up the offer of a jab, NHS England said.

But the Office for National Statistics (ONS ) has warned the UK is "not out of the woods yet".

More than 18 million people in England have already had one dose of the vaccine - over a third of the entire adult population.

The latest figures show that across the UK, nearly 21.4 million people have now had one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, with more than a million now having had both doses required.
